# Covid prep 101
## Background in July 2021
Fix the roof while the sun shines. Supply chain constraints are likely to get worse globally, and the covid situation in the UK is likely to deteriorate. Now is the time to act
## Basic steps everyone should take
Buying things creates options if you or family members get sick. A committment to buy something is not a committment to use it. The list below is purposefully very short to make it easy and relatively cheap. There is a lot more one can and should do. The items below take 5 minutes to order and cost approx. GBP 195 in total (excluding the Niclosamide which is hard to source). 

1. Buy compounds that are very low downside and that are likely to help in case of infection (do read info leaflets and take under medical supervision if appropriate).
    * [Ambroxyl](https://www.amazon.co.uk/AMBROXOL-Cough-Reliever-Throat-Tablets/dp/B08C2DQJHB/). GBP 60 for 300. Ambroxyl helps block viral entry into lung cells. It is an over-the-couter cough medicine in Europe with an excellent safety profile. See Laeeth'e personal plan for details
    * [Ivermectin](https://medicinevilla.com/product/ivermectin-tablet/). USD 120 for 100 tablets. Ivermectin has anti-imflammatory and anti-viral properties. It is well tolerated and widely used as an anti-parasitic. Dosage advice varies and more information is in Laeeth's personal plan.
    * Niclosamide was previosuly available on ebay.com as Zenda 1000 but the item is no longer listed. In Europe it is available over-the-couter as Yomesan

1. Restock protective kit
    * [FFP3/N99 masks with valve](https://www.amazon.co.uk/3M-9332PP-Valve-Folded-White/dp/B000VDQL4K/). GBP 21 for 3 masks. These offer excellent protection and the valves make them more comfortable to wear
    * [FFP3/N99 masks without valve](https://www.amazon.co.uk/3M-9330-Aura-Unvalved-Respirator/dp/B00VAT74NG/). GBP 10 for 3 masks. These are good to wear if, for example, someone has to enter your house as the mask will reduce any virus they exhale
    * [Nitrile gloves](https://www.amazon.co.uk/TouchGuard-Nitrile-Disposable-Gloves-Powder-Free/dp/B07QDXY4GF/) GBP 14 per box
